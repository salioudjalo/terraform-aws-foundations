# Terraform AWS Foundations

This repository contains hands-on Terraform projects focused on building
production-grade AWS infrastructure from scratch.

The goal of this repo is to demonstrate real-world Terraform skills:
clean module design, reusable infrastructure components, and AWS best practices.
